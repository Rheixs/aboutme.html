<h1> Who Am I </h1>

<p>Back home, people will easily recognize me even from the back as someone of my height, a 5’8” at my age.
 But in seriousness, like any other individual that possesses something special. Opening ourselves to different
 perspective does nothing but helps us to adapt to more things and to improve ourselves in order to help others,
 and society. I am working hard to being open in and cautious in life. Knowing each individuality opens door to many 
 perspectives in life which is healthy. And knowing yourself thoroughly is important before getting along with others.<br><br>
 
 Life is a work in progress but one of my principle in life is, never regret - a lot of times we commit mistakes, 
 but we know that we are humans and to keep moving you need to keep doing things that are right and wrong. Instead
 of regretting, learn and move on!<br><br>

 I am just like every other girl out there and similar to my fellow students in several ways. To be able to finish my 
 studies and to fulfill my ambition to be an engineer.  Everything is possible in life with hard work and a positive 
 attitude. I am trying hard, to get good marks in the classes. And I think, aside from my height, the other thing that 
 makes me different from others is, being a working scholar. To juggle between work and study, finances, and schedules. 
 Apparently, not every parent has the luxury to send their children to college. But I am determined to finish college 
 and be an engineer, hence I am working hard towards the future.<br><br>
 
 We, in my family, are proud of my little achievements from being a math wizard in elementary, to participating in enter 
 school dance competitions and beauty pageants. I am not hungry for fame, popularity, or any type of monetary benefit.
 Perhaps less noticeable, but those small wins and success in school definitely boosted my self-esteem and somehow prepared
 me to be alone in the city, to pursue my study. We may not always win in life, but those kinds of accomplishments often 
 don’t come easily. After all, it’s the smaller, “quieter” successes in life that can add up to a lot, especially when it comes
 to the self-esteem of every individual.<br><br>
 
 I am eager and hoping to finish my study, to have a successful career and a happy family someday, just like everyone else’s dreams.
